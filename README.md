## Project Description

The goal of this project is to explore and visualize FIFA World Cup history by:
- Analyzing trends in goals scored and attendance over time
- Investigating team and player performance
- Building a normalized relational database for efficient querying and analysis

---

## Data Sources

- **Primary dataset:** [Kaggle FIFA World Cup Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Contains match-level, tournament-level, and player-level data from 1930 to 2014

---

## Database Schema

The project uses a MySQL database with three main tables:

| Table              | Description                  | Key Columns                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `cups`             | Tournament-level data        | year, country, winner, attendance, etc.     |
| `worldcup_matches` | Match-level data             | year, date, teams, goals, attendance, etc.  |
| `players`          | Player-level match data      | roundid, matchid, player_name, position     |

- Foreign key relationships ensure referential integrity between tournaments, matches, and players.

---

## Data Cleaning

- Removed rows with missing or invalid data (e.g., empty or `<NA>` rows).
- Converted columns like `attendance` and `year` from float/string to integer for consistency.
- Standardized country/team names for accurate grouping.
- Cleaned attendance formatting (e.g., "590.549" â†’ "590549").
- Updated MySQL schema to match cleaned data types.

---

## Analysis Highlights

- Explored trends in average goals per match and total/average attendance.
- Found that attendance has increased over time, while goals per match fluctuate.
- Visualized tournament winners, top-performing teams, and key match statistics.
